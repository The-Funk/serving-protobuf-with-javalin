# serving-protobuf-with-javalin

## Description

This is a community example of serving Protobuf over a REST API with Javalin. The project uses the Gradle build system and the official Google Gradle plugin for Protobuf generation. If Grade isn't your thing, the project also contains a pair of custom build scripts to help automate the protocol buffer compilation process to some degree.

## Getting Started

To start, clone or fork this repository. You could also download just the source if you desire. If using the build scripts, make sure both git and protoc are installed on the target system and in your path.
